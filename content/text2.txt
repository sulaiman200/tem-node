Definition and Usage

The align-content property specifies how flex lines are distributed along the cross axis in a flexbox container.

In flexbox layout, the main axis is in the flex-direction (default is 'row', horizontal), and the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis (default is 'column', vertical).

Tip: Use the justify-content property to align the items on the main axis (horizontally).

Note: The align-content property can also be used on a grid container to align grid items in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to right.
